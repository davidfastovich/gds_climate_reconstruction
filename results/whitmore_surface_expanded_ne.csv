Instead, all pollen percentages were multiplied by 10 and input as raw counts. Counts from the six spore categories, Lycopodium, Osmundaceae, Polypodiaceae, Equisetum, Botrychium, and Sphagnum were deleted from this file because the sum used to calculate their percentages was unclear. Corrections made on this file by K.H.Anderson 11/30/89 These corrections were identified by abnormal Quercus counts. The percentage table used for inputting these values was shifted at 630 cm on page 106, note the tab used in the table where Ostrya carpinus has a - (0) value and a value of .2 while the last taxa on the table Castanea had no count indication at all not even a dash (-).
