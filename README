THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS ALL OF THE CODE NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE FOSSIL-POLLEN
CLIMATE RECONSTRUCTIONS FROM WILLARD ET AL., (2023). DURING THIS RESEARCH WE
EXPANDED THE NORTH AMERICAN MODERN POLLEN DATABASE WITH ADDITIONAL SAMPLES FROM
THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP REGIONAL AND THE ROANOKE RIVER BASIN. THESE NEW SAMPLES
HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE NORTH AMERICAN MODERN POLLEN DATABASE WITH CLIMATE
PARAMETERS FROM THE CLIMATE RESEARCH UNIT TS V4 BILINEARLY INTERPOLATED TO THE
MODERN SAMPLE LOCATIONS.

# TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR FILES
#############################

/CRU/.

* DATA DOWNLOADED FROM THE HIGH-RESOLUTION GRIDDED DATASETS (AND DERIVED
PRODUCTS) FROM HTTPS://CRUDATA.UEA.AC.UK/CRU/DATA/HRG/.

/DIAGNOSTICS/.

* DIAGNOSTIC PLOTS OF EITHER THE RECONSTRUCTIONS OR OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE
ABILITY TO RECONSTRUCT THESE CLIMATE PARAMETERS FROM THE MODERN CALIBRATION
DATASET.

/POLLEN_COUNTS/.

* POLLEN COUNTS FOR THE CORES FROM THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP REGION, SURFACE
SAMPLES FROM THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP REGION, SURFACE SAMPLES FROM THE ROANOKE
RIVER BASIN, AND SURFACE SAMPLES FROM THE NORTH AMERICAN MODERN POLLEN DATABASE
TAKEN FROM HTTP://WWW.LPC.UOTTAWA.CA/DATA/MODERN/.

/RESULTS/.

* FINAL FOSSIL-POLLEN RECONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP CORES.

/SPLITS/.

* SHAPEFILES USED FOR SPLITTING PROCEDURE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL
INFORMATION OF WILLIAMS AND SHUMAN (2008, QSR).

/TAXA_CONVERSION_LIST/.

* HOMEBREWED TAXA CONVERSION LISTS THAT MAKE IT A BIT EASIER TO CONVERT FROM THE
NAMING SCHEMA OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MODERN POLLEN DATABASE TO REGULAR TAXON
NAMES AND VICE-VERSA. THE WS64_EXTENDED.CSV LIST IS TAKEN FROM THE NEOTOMA R
PACKAGE SOURCE CODE AND I'VE SLOWLY ADDED ADDITIONAL TAXA TO THE LIST AS
NECESSARY FOR MY OWN ANALYSES.

/MAKE_RECONSTRUCTION.SH

* SHELL SCRIPT TO REDO ALL OF THE ANALYSES. PLEASE READ THE .SH FILE BEFORE
RUNNING.

/CRU_BILINEAR_INTERPOLATE.PY

* PYTHON SCRIPT TO BILINEARLY INTERPOLATE THE CRU TS V4 TO THE NEW MODERN POLLEN
COUNTS.

/MODERN_COMPILE.R

* R SCRIPT TO ADD THE NEW MODERN POLLEN COUNTS TO THE NORTH AMERICAN MODERN
POLLEN DATABASE. LARGELY, IT INVOLVES RENAMING AND RESHAPING DATA.

/POLLEN_SPLIT.PY

* PYTHON SCRIPT TO SPLIT OUR EXPANDED VERSION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MODERN
POLLEN DATABASE INTO SOUTHEASTERN PINUS SITES, NORTHEASTERN PINUS SITES, AND
EASTERN PICEA SITES BASED ON SHAPEFILES FROM WILLIAMS AND SHUMAN (2008, QSR)
WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION.

/RECONSTRUCTION.R

* R SCRIPT TO PERFORM THE FOSSIL-POLLEN RECONSTRUCTIONS ALONGSIDE REQUISITE
DIAGNOSTIC CHECKS.

/MODERN_POLLEN_RDA.R

* SCRIPT TO CONFIRM THAT WE CAN RECONSTRUCT OUR DESIRED CLIMATE PARAMETERS FROM
THE NORTH AMERICAN MODERN POLLEN DATABASE BASED ON OUR SPLITTING PROCEDURE AND
TAXA LIST.

/ROANOKE_SURFACE_TAXA_NOT_IN_WHITMORE.TXT

* DIAGNOSTIC TEXTFILE THAT TELLS ME WHAT TAXA ARE PRESENT IN THE ROANOKE SURFACE
SAMPLES BUT ARE NOT PRESENT IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MODERN POLLEN DATABASE.

/DISMAL_SURFACE_TAXA_NOT_IN_WHITMORE.TXT

* DIAGNOSTIC TEXTFILE THAT TELLS ME WHAT TAXA ARE PRESENT IN THE GREAT DISMAL
SWAMP SURFACE SAMPLES BUT ARE NOT PRESENT IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MODERN POLLEN
DATABASE.

/ENVIRONMENT.YML

* FILE TO BUILD AN IDENTICAL CONDA ENVIRONMENT TO THE ONE I USED FOR ALL
ANALYSES
